The WSGI Application
====================

When you create an application using the ``nagare-admin create-app`` command (see :wiki:`ApplicationCreation`
for more details), Nagare automatically creates a class which acts as the *root component* of your
application:

.. code-block:: python

    setup(
          ...
          entry_points = """
          [nagare.applications]
          myapp = myapp.app:app
          """
          ...
    )

.. code-block:: python

    class Root(object):
        # root component of the application
        pass
    
    @presentation.render_for(Root)
    def render(self, h, *args):
        # some rendering code...
        return h.root
        
    app = Root

Under the hood, Nagare automatically wraps this *root component* in a ``WSGIApp`` instance
(see :apidoc:`wsgi#wsgi.WSGIApp`) via the ``create_WSGIApp`` function (see :apidoc:`wsgi#wsgi.create_WSGIApp`).
The ``WSGIApp`` is the plumbing between the `WSGI protocol`_ and Nagare's component API (:apidoc:`component`):
it exposes a WSGI interface to the host server (i.e. a *publisher* in Nagare terms) and maps the incoming
requests to components updates and rendering. So, in short, the ``WSGIApp`` implements the WSGI application that
serves your Nagare components as Web pages.

The ``WSGIApp`` provides some smart defaults for the common use-cases: there's no authentication by default, a
default locale is used so that localizable strings are returned as is, the exceptions that occur while
processing your components are hidden behind a HTTP Internal Server Error, etc. 

However, sometimes, you want to override this default application behavior: for example, you may want to use a user
authentication scheme, show custom error pages when exceptions occur, initialize something in each request, change
the locale, ... We are going to show you how to do that, but we must first explain how Nagare handles a client request
so that you can understand how to customize the application behavior.


How Nagare handles a client request
-----------------------------------

When the WSGI server receives a client request, it calls the ``WSGIApp.__call__`` method of the application
(see :apidoc:`wsgi#wsgi.WSGIApp.__call__`), which returns the content of the response for this request, as described
in the `WSGI protocol`_. This is where Nagare does all the work so that your components are served as a Web pages on
top of WSGI.

First, Nagare analyzes the incoming request in order to retrieve the session information (i.e. which user is
sending the request to the server), and (eventually) the action the user triggered on the last page he visited.

The session information is represented by the ``_s`` and ``_c`` parameters of the URL. If the session information is
either missing, expired or invalid, Nagare creates a new session and sets up the initial state of the application by
calling the root component factory (i.e. the function passed to the ``WSGIApp`` constructor). This factory returns an
instance of the root component that, once rendered, will be the first page the user will see. Otherwise, Nagare uses the
session information to load the corresponding session data and initializes the components state from this data, which
effectively put the components in the same setup as in the previous page.

When significative URLs are used (see :wiki:`RestfulUrl`), the URL is used to initialize the state of the components when
a new session is created and is ignored otherwise (because the session data carries more state information than the URL
itself).

Once the components are initialized, Nagare finds and executes the action callback (represented by the ``_actionNNN``
parameter of the URL, where ``NNN`` is a random number) which updates the state of the components to reflect the consequences
of the action (see :wiki:`CallbacksAndForms` for more information about actions). This is the *callback processing* phase.

Finally, Nagare creates a renderer and renders the components tree starting from the root component. This is the *rendering*
phase. At this point, we are not supposed to change the component graph, but it's possible nevertheless.

After the rendering, the state of the components is persisted in the session store, which is either in memory, in `memcache`_,
or not at all, depending on the publisher configuration (see :wiki:`PublisherConfiguration`). The session stored can then be
used in the next request to initialize the components before executing the action callback.

The same principles applies when your components are rendered asynchronously (i.e. with an ``AsyncRenderer``), except that only
a components subtree is rendered (starting from the asynchronous root) and the same session state is written over and over
instead of creating a new state for each request as in synchronous mode.

To sum up, there are 4 important steps when handling a request:

1. initialize the components from the session or from the URL (if a new session begins)
2. update the components tree by processing the action callbacks
3. render the components tree
4. save the new state in the session

That's basically what the ``WSGIApp.__call__`` method does. However, note that there are many hooks called in
this method that can be overridden to customize the application behavior. That's what we're going to review now.


Customizing the WSGIApp
-----------------------

It's possible to customize the ``WSGIApp`` behavior by subclassing the ``WSGIApp`` class and changing the global ``app``
attribute to refer to the ``WSGIApp`` subclass, as shown below:

.. code-block:: python

    from nagare import wsgi
    
    ...
    
    class MyApp(wsgi.WSGIApp):
        # put your customization code here
        pass
    
    def root_factory():
        return component.Component(Root())
    
    app = MyApp(root_factory)


The ``WSGIApp`` constructor accepts a root component *factory* as single argument, which is used to create the *root
component* when a new session begins, that is, the initial state of the application when a new user comes in.

There are many methods that can be overridden in the ``WSGIApp``. Maybe the most important one is ``WSGIApp.__call__``
which has already been described: it implements the `WSGI protocol`_. Most of the time, you don't need to override this
method directly because Nagare provides finer grained methods.

The ``WSGIApp.start_request`` method (see :apidoc:`wsgi#wsgi.WSGIApp.start_request`) is called at the begin of each
incoming request. This is where we can perform request- or session-specific initializations such as installing the locale
depending on the user/browser settings, authenticating the user using the credentials sent in the request, initializing
request or session scoped data... The first parameter of this method receives the root component that has just been
created or been initialized from the session, before URL rules are process (i.e. ``presentation.init`` rules). The last
two parameters are the request and the response objects.

The ``WSGIApp.set_config`` method (see :apidoc:`wsgi#wsgi.WSGIApp.set_config`) is another commonly used method: it's the
place where the application receives its configuration. You can read custom configuration sections and values in
this method in order to configure the services that you use in your application.

For completeness, here is the full listing of the overridable methods and their purpose:

                                                                   attribute to create the renderer, which is initialized by

``on_callback_lookuperror(request, response, async)``              A callback was not found: this generally occurs when you use

Some examples
-------------

In order to illustrate how to use the ``WSGIApp`` methods, here are some examples showing how to solve
common use-cases in Nagare applications.


Reading a specific configuration section to initialize a service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Imagine that you want to send emails to the visitors of your next Web application. You need to connect to
a SMTP server but, for obvious reasons, you want to be able to configure the host and the port of the SMTP
server your Web application will connect to.

In the application configuration file, we can add a specific section that provides the configuration
information for the mail sender service.

.. code-block:: ini

    [mail]
    host = mail.server.com
    port = 25


In order to read this configuration section, we need to override the ``WSGIApp.set_config`` method.

.. code-block:: python

    import configobj
    from nagare import wsgi, config
    from myapp.mailsender import MailSender
    
    class MyApp(wsgi.WSGIApp):
        APPLICATION_SPEC = {
            'mail': {
                'host': 'string(default="localhost")',
                'port': 'integer(default=25)',
            },
        }
        
        def set_config(self, config_filename, conf, error):
            # call the base implementation
            super(MyApp, self).set_config(config_filename, conf, error)
    
            # read the configuration values
            conf = configobj.ConfigObj(conf, configspec=configobj.ConfigObj(self.APPLICATION_SPEC))
            config.validate(config_filename, conf, error)

            # create the mail sender service instance
            mail_host = conf['mail']['host']
            mail_port = conf['mail']['port']
            self.mail_sender = MailSender(mail_host, mail_port)

        ...

First, we validate and read the configuration file, then we get the ``host`` and ``port`` values needed
to configure our ``MailSender`` service. When creating the ``ConfigObj`` object, we use a ``configspec``
to:

1. validate the correctness of the configuration file
2. provide "smart" default values for the missing configuration keys

Now that the mail sender service is created, we must pass it to the Nagare components that need it.
The configured mail sender instance can be passed to the root component by overriding the 
``WSGIApp.create_root`` method:

.. code-block:: python

    class MyApp(wsgi.WSGIApp):
        ...

        def create_root(self, *args, **kw):
            return super(MyApp, self).create_root(self.mail_sender)


Then the root component can use the mail sender instance or pass it to its children components:

.. code-block:: python

    class Root(object):
        def __init__(self, mail_sender)
            self.mail_sender = mail_sender
            # do something useful with the mail_sender:
            # use it in an action callback or pass it to a children component

    def root_factory(mail_sender):
        return component.Component(Root(mail_sender))
    
    app = MyApp(root_factory)


Authenticating users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nagare applications have no user authentification by default, so all visitors are allowed
to see your application. This default behavior is installed in the ``WSGIApp`` constructor.
You can change it by creating a custom security manager using one of the authentification
schemes available in the ``nagare.security`` package (such as a HTTP Basic authentication or
a Form authentication retrieving users from a database).

Then, the custom security manager can be installed either in ``WSGIApp.__init__``,
``WSGIApp.set_config`` or ``WSGIApp.start_request``. Here is an example:

.. code-block:: python

    from myapp.security import MySecurityManager
    
    class MyApp(wsgi.WSGIApp):
        def __init__(self, root_factory):
             super(MyApp, self).__init__(root_factory)
             self.security = MySecurityManager()


Installing a locale in each request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Basically, you can change the default locale globally by calling ``WSGIApp.set_default_locale``, or
just change the locale for the current request by calling ``WSGIApp.set_locale`` (according to a user
or session locale setting for example). Some examples can be found in
:wiki:`InternationalizationOfApplications`.


Serving an application in /
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, an application named ``myapp`` is served in ``/myapp``, but you may want your application
to respond in the root URL (i.e. ``/``) too. To achieve that, you must tell the ``publisher`` that your
application must be registered to the root URL. This can be done by overriding the
``WSGIApp.set_publisher`` method:

.. code-block:: python

    class MyApp(wsgi.WSGIApp):
        def set_publisher(self, publisher):
            # call the base implementation
            super(EurekaBase, self).set_publisher(publisher)
            
            # register the application in the root URL
            publisher.register_application(self.application_path, "", self, self)

Note that the static contents of the application are still be served in ``/static/myapp``.


Building absolute URLs in components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Imagine that you want to send an email to a user containing a link to your Web application, maybe a
welcome email. In order to do that, you need to create absolute URLs pointing to the application, and
you need to know the base URL of the application to do that. You may use a specific key in the
configuration file to store the server host URL. An alternative way would be to use the URL of the host
accessed by the request being processed. You can access the request data and pass the host URL to the
root component in the ``WSGIApp.start_request`` method, as show in the following example:

.. code-block:: python

    import urlparse
    
    class Root(object):
        host_url = None

        def absolute_url(self, url)
            return urlparse.urljoin(self.host_url, url)


.. code-block:: python

    class MyApp(wsgi.WSGIApp):
        def start_request(self, root, request, response):
            # Update the host_url attribute of the Root instance
            root().host_url = request.host_url


Logging unhandled exceptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can intercept unhandled exceptions and log them to the application logger by overriding
the ``WSGIApp.on_exception`` method, as show in the example below:

.. code-block:: python

    from nagare import log
    
    class MyApp(wsgi.WSGIApp):
        def on_exception(self, request, response):
            # log the current exception (i.e. sys.exc_info())
            log.exception('An error occured')
            
            # return an internal server error to the client
            return webob.exc.HTTPInternalServerError()
