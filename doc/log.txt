The log service
===============

It's often useful to log some information during the execution of a Web
application to trace the execution of the requests and to provide useful
information for debugging when something goes wrong. The most common use-case is
to log the exceptions tracebacks to a file on the server that provide the context
where the error occurred so that we can fix the problem without disclosing
sensitive information to the end-users.

Python ships with a `logging`_ module that provides everything we need in a Web
development context. However, it is relatively complex to configure and it's
configuration is a singleton, which is problematic in a multi-applications setup
(that is, when the same ``nagare-admin serve`` process serves more than one
application).

In order to solve these problems, Nagare provides its own ``log`` service
(see :apidoc:`log`), which is built on top of the `logging`_ module but greatly
simplifies its usage and configuration for common use-cases.


Basic Usages
------------

Using The default logger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, when you serve Web applications with the ``nagare-admin serve``
utility, Nagare creates a dedicated logger, handler and formatter for each
application, and activates them: this is the purpose of the
:apidoc:`log#log.configure` and :apidoc:`log#log.activate` functions.

You can use the module level functions of the ``log`` module to write messages
to the default logger of the *currently running* application, as shown in the
example below:

.. code-block:: python
    :hl_lines: 8

    from nagare import presentation, log

    class Root(object):
        pass

    @presentation.render_for(Root)
    def render(self, h, *args):
        log.info('Rendering the Root component')
        # some rendering code...
        return h.root

    app = Root


Then, each time the default view of the ``Root`` component is rendered, this
line should appear in the console shell (which is the output of the default
logger):

.. code-block:: text

    2012-06-14 10:22:38,379 - nagare.application.myapp - INFO - Rendering the root component

As you see, the messages are issued in the ``nagare.application.myapp``
namespace, which is the namespace of the messages coming from the Nagare
application called ``myapp``.

Here is the full listing of the module-level functions of the ``nagare.log``
module:

====================================== =================================================================
              Function                                             Effect
====================================== =================================================================
``log.debug(msg, *args, **kw)``        Logs a message with ``DEBUG`` level on the application logger
``log.info(msg, *args, **kw)``         Logs a message with ``INFO`` level on the application logger
``log.warning(msg, *args, **kw)``      Logs a message with ``WARNING`` level on the application logger
``log.error(msg, *args, **kw)``        Logs a message with ``ERROR`` level on the application logger
``log.critical(msg, *args, **kw)``     Logs a message with ``CRITICAL`` level on the application logger
``log.exception(msg, *args, **kw)``    Logs a message with ``ERROR`` level on the application logger,
                                       and also logs the current exception information
``log.log(level, msg, *args, **kw)``   Logs a message with the specified level on the application
                                       logger
====================================== =================================================================

All these functions accept variable arguments and keyword arguments, which are
documented in the ``logging`` module, `here <http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html#logging.Logger.debug>`_.

Overriding the default configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``[[logger]]``, ``[[hander]]`` and ``[[formatter]]`` sub-sections of the
``[logging]`` section in the application configuration file are dedicated to
configure the default application logger.

The default logging setup is equivalent to the following ``[logging]`` section,
where ``<name>`` is replaced by the name of the application (please
refer to the ``logging``'s module `configuration file format`_ for a better
understanding of the configuration of loggers, handlers and formatters):

.. code-block:: ini

    [logging]

    [[logger]]
    qualname=nagare.application.<name>
    level=INFO
    propagate=1

    [[handler]]
    class=StreamHandler
    args=(sys.stderr,)

    [[formatter]]
    format=%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s

As you can see, by default, the log messages with a level greater or equal to
``INFO`` are printed to ``sys.stderr`` via a ``StreamHandler``.

It's possible to override this default ``logging`` configuration by adding your
own ``[logging]`` section to the application configuration file. Here, the
logging level of the application is set to ``DEBUG``:

.. code-block:: ini

    [logging]
    [[logger]]
    level=DEBUG

Here, a new handler is defined to log the messages to the file ``/tmp/myapp.log``.
We use a ``RotatingFileHandler`` instead of the classical ``FileHandler`` since
we want the file to be log-rotated in order to prevent it from becoming too large:

.. code-block:: ini

    [logging]
    [[handler]]
    class=handlers.RotatingFileHandler
    args="('/tmp/myapp.log', 'a', 10485760, 10, 'UTF-8')"

Using the Nagare IDE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the Nagare IDE is launched at the same time than your application
(i.e ``nagare-admin serve <name> ide``), a second handler is bound to the default
logger so that all the messages are also sent to the
`IDE log panel <http://www.nagare.org/trac/wiki/NagareIde#logger>`_.

Advanced Usages
---------------

Creating other application loggers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As seen above, Nagare makes it easy to log messages in an application. However,
as your application becomes more complex and is broken down in several modules
and packages, it may become hard to track down where you sent a particular message
or to analyze the log file which is now filled with numerous log messages.

In this situation, it's generally useful to organize the log messages into
namespaces, so that we can enable/disable the logging of messages in some
namespaces or send messages with different namespaces to different handlers.

For this purpose, Nagare offers a ``log.get_logger(namespace)`` function that
creates a logger which puts the messages into the specified namespace. To create a
new logger for your application, use a relative name starting with a dot. In this
case, the new namespace is relative to the application namespace, e.g.
``nagare.application.myapp``.

The logger object offers the same functions as the ``log`` module for writing
messages, that is ``logger.debug``, ``logger.info``, ``logger.warning``,
``logger.error``, ``logger.critical``, ``logger.exception`` and ``logger.log``,
with the same parameters.

In this example, we will log all the messages generated in the views to a
specific ``nagare.application.myapp.ui`` namespace:

.. code-block:: python

    from nagare import log

    @presentation.render_for(Root)
    def render(self, h, *args):
        log.get_logger('.ui').debug('Rendering the Root component')
        # some rendering code...
        return h.root

and you can see, the message is now attached to the ``nagare.application.myapp.myapp.ui``
namespace:

.. code-block:: text

    2012-06-14 10:22:38,379 - nagare.application.myapp.ui - INFO - Rendering the root component

Being under the ``nagare.application.myapp`` namespace, this logger propagates
the messages to the default logger. Also this logger inherits the default logger
configuration, which can be overridden:

.. code-block:: ini

    [[logging]]
    [loggers]
    keys=ui   # Declare the new logger

    [[logger_ui]]
    qualname=.ui    # Relative namespace
    level=CRITICAL
    # No specific handler: propagate the messages to the default application logger
    handlers=

Here the log level of the logger is set to ``CRITICAL``.

Or a more complex configuration can be created, for example to log the messages
to a specific log file:

.. code-block:: ini

    [logging]
    [[loggers]]
    keys=ui   # Declare the new logger

    [[handlers]]
    keys=logfile   # Declare the new handler

    [[formatters]]
    keys=simple   # Declare the new formatter

    [[logger_ui]]
    qualname=.ui    # Relative namespace
    handlers=logfile
    propagate=0   # Don't propagate the messages to the default application logger

    [[handler_logfile]]
    class=handlers.RotatingFileHandler
    args="('/tmp/myapp_ui.log', 'a', 10485760, 10, 'UTF-8')"  # Specific log file
    formatter=simple

    [[formatter_simple]]
    format=%(levelname)s: %(message)s

Creating other loggers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any other general loggers can be created the same way, by just giving a full
absolute namespace.

For example the `SQLAlchemy documentation <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_7/core/engines.html#configuring-logging>`_
states the name of the SQL query logger is ``sqlalchemy.engine``. So this
logging configuration will display all the generated SQL queries:

.. code-block:: ini

    [logging]
    [[loggers]]
    keys=sa

    [[handlers]]
    keys=stderr

    [[formatters]]
    keys=multilines

    [[logger_sa]]
    qualname=sqlalchemy.engine   # The absolute SQLAlchemy logger namespace
    level=INFO
    handlers=stderr

    [[handler_stderr]]
    class=StreamHandler
    args=(sys.stderr,)
    formatter=multilines

    [[formatter_multilines]]
    format={ %(message)s }
