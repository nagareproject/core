Entry points
============

The entry points are a mecanism to extend the framework.

How the entry points are declared in the ``setup.py`` file of your project
is described in the `Setuptools documentation <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools#extensible-applications-and-frameworks>`_.

The framework knows about the following entry points:

  - ``nagare.applications``: this entry point is the most often used as it registers
    an application to the framework.

    An application can be an instance of ``WSGIApp``, configurated with a
    component factory, or a direct component factory which, in this case, will
    be automatically wrapped into a default ``WSGIApp`` object.

  - ``nagare.publishers``: these entry points defined the publishers that can be
    selected with the ``type`` parameter of the
    `publisher configuration file <publisher_file.html#publisher-section>`__

    The framework publishers are defined into the :mod:`nagare.publishers`
    package. The class :class:`nagare.publishers.common.Publisher` is the base class of
    all the publishers.

  - ``nagare.sessions``: there entry points defined the sessions manager that can be
    selected with the ``type`` paramater of the
    `publisher configuration file <publisher_file.html#sessions-section>`__.

    The framework sessions managers are defined into the :mod:`nagare.sessions`
    package. The class :class:`nagare.sessions.common.Sessions`
    is the base class of all the sessions managers.

  -  ``nagare.commands``: these entry points defined new administrative commands
     (launched with :doc:`nagare-admin`)

     All the build-in administrative commands of the framework are defined into
     the :mod:`nagare.admin` package. The class :class:`nagare.admin.command.Command`
     is the interface an administrative command must respect.

  - ``nagare.admin``: these entry points defined components that will be rendered
    into the "Nagare Administration interface" page (launched with ``nagare-admin serve admin``).
    See the ``admin/interface/info.py`` and ``admin/interface/applications.py`` files.
